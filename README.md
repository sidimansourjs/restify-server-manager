# restify-server-manager
 A module to create/start/stop a [restify.js](http://restify.com) server based on configuration.   

 This module aims to help developers try to create an API with Restify. It allows easy set up and includes some **features** that can be enabled via configuration settings: 

 **json-web-token**, **monitoring**, **pre/while/after request hooks**, **formatters**, **error handling**, **heartbeat route**, **logging** ... **and some other features!**

 Includes restify error handling from [https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-error-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-error-handler)

 Adds required security headers to the JSON API and the needed uses and handlers to get a JSON API running.

 Makes use of Restify `after` event on each route to allow easy configuration for functional monitoring and Audit


## Install
```
npm install --save restify-server-manager
```

## Purpose
To provide a component that creates a restify server object based on passed configuration, and starts/stops the server on demand.


## Configuration

Config object example HTTP:

		{
	    	name: name,
		  	routes: ["/src/server/routes/paymentRouter"],
	    	version: version,
			monitorer: {
				enabled: true,
				basepath: 'http://127.0.0.1:8089',
				urlpath: '/api/v1/logone',
			},
			logging: {
				enabled: true,
				level: "trace",
				audit: true,
				path: "/logs",
				rotation_period: "15m",
				back_copies_count: 2
			},
			formatters: {
				'application/foo': function formatFoo(req, res, body, cb) {
				  if (body instanceof Error)
					return body.stack;

				  if (Buffer.isBuffer(body))
					return cb(null, body.toString('base64'));

				  return cb(null, util.inspect(body));
				}
			  },
			server:
			{
				port: 8480,
				protocol: HTTP,
				url: "http://127.0.0.1:8480"
			 }
  	    }

Config object example HTTPS:

		{
		    name: name,
			routes: [],
			monitorer: {
				enabled: true,
				basepath: 'http://127.0.0.1:8089',
				urlpath: '/api/v1/logone',
			},
		    version: version,
			server:
			{
				port: 8480,
				protocol: HTTPS,
				url: "https://127.0.0.1:8480",
				"tsl": {
					"key": "certs/server-key.pem",
					"cert": "certs/server-cert.pem"
				}
			 }
  	    }


## Testing
run all tests  
`npm test`

run coverage
`grunt coverage`

## Examples

Basic configuration with logging enabled.

	var ServerManager = require('restify-server-manager').RestifyServerManager;
	var _conf = {
		name: 'name',
		routes: [],
		version: '1.0.0',
		logging: {
			enabled: true,
			level: "trace",
			audit: false,
			path: "/logs",
			rotation_period: "15m",
			back_copies_count: 2
		},
		server:
		{
			port: 8480,
			protocol: 'HTTP',
			url: "http://127.0.0.1:8480"
		 }
	}

	var serverManager = new ServerManager(_conf);

	var server = serverManager.createServer();

	serverManager.startServer();

In the example above you can add the `monitorer` property to add an `after` handler to designated routes. This handler will send a formatted object with information about the route I/O as well as basic information about the status of the route call.

	monitorer: {
			enabled: true,
			basepath: 'http://127.0.0.1:8089',
			urlpath: '/api/v1/log',
		},

This after handler will send the below information to the defined final end point. In order to enable this feature you should add the `monitor`

	server.post({ path: "/payment/", version: "1.0.0", monitor: true }

Monitorer information example:

	{
	    "type" : "fatal",
	    "service" : "postpayment100",
	    "group" : "[app name] - 1.3.4",
	    "result" : "error",
	    "when" : "2016-06-22T08:10:23.000+0000",
	    "box" : "********",
	    "info" : {
	        "remoteAddress" : "************",
	        "remotePort" : 56217,
	        "req_id" : "**********",
	        "route" : "postpayment100",
	        "req" : {
	            "query" : {
					...
	            },
	            "params" : {
	                ...
	            },
	            "body" : {
	                ...
	            },
	            "route" : {
	                "path" : "/payment/",
	                "version" : "1.0.0",  
	                "monitor" : true,
	                "method" : "POST",
	                "versions" : [
	                    "2.0.0"
	                ],
	                "name" : "postpayment100"
	            },
	            "context" : {
	                ...
	            },
	            "headers" : {
	                ...
	            }
	        },
	        "res" : {
	            ...
	        },
	        "latency" : 13
	    }
	}

There is also a way to stop the server on demand. In the above example the server will be stop by calling the `stopServer` method

	serverManager.stopServer()
